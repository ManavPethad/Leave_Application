This repository contains all the files related to the leave request application for any college where there is a hostel. The app contains 2 type of logins, a student login and a faculty login. The student login has a form which the student has to fill and submit tthe form to request the leave. 
Once the student submits the form the details are sent to the allocated mentor faculty. The mentor faculty will review the request and then approve or reject the application. The application rejected or accepted will be available on the student dashboard and the student can show the hostel that the leave is approved.
